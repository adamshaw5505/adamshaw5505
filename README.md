Hi I'm Adam, this github conatins a few projects I have worked on over the years. Including projects for my Physics with Theorerical Physics degree and my Mathematical Physics PhD.

Differential Forms:
This is a python package, built upon sympy, that allows generic tensor manipulations. As the name suggest it is designed around the use of differential forms. This package is a work in development and will be updated when I require it to do certain tasks. Bug fixes are infrequent.

Numerical Integrator:
This is code I have written, in C++, for the purposes of numercically integrating different systems of partial differential equations. It is built around the method of lines and allows for custom PDE's to added with not too much work. In general it works in 3D however there is built in functionality for lower dimensions.
